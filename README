Project to build data binding backend that uses standard Jackson data binding but reads and writes XML, similar to how JAXB works (hence nicknames "mini-JAXB" and "XML4Jackson")

Implemented outside of core Jackson to allow faster development and release cycles; as well as to limit growth of core project code base.

See wiki page -- https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-xml-databind/wiki -- for more information

(also, temporary home page at http://fasterxml.github.com/jackson-xml-databind/ has interesting stuff)
