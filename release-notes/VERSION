2.1.0 (08-Oct-2012)

New minor version, with following changes:

* [Issue#6]: Add support for "unwrapped lists"; now unwrapped is also default

  compatibility). @JacksonXmlElementWrapper allows explicit per-property
  overrides
* [Issue#30]: (from JAXB module, issue #11) Now `@XmlIDREF` forces use of
  id value for serialization of a reference property.
* [Issue#33]: Ignore attributes of elements for "List" objects
* [Issue#36]: Add 'JacksonXmlModule.setXMLTextElementName()' to allow
  matching 'value' text property of JAXB beans.

  for POJOs.
